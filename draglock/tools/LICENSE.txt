DonationCoder.com is a site for people who love computer software, and like the idea of supporting each other's work through donations - it's funded entirely by individuals who join the site.

Some of our members are professional programmers, but most don't care about programming and just like to debate about which programs are the best for any given task. Most of our software discussions focus on Microsoft Windows software, but hey if you want to come talk about your favorite commodore 64 software feel free, we love to reminisce and talk about our shared hatred of everything Apple. Ha ha ha just kidding, we've got some mac lovers on our site too :)
