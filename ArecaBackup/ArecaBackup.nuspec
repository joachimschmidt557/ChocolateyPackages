    <description>Areca Backup basically allows you to select a set of files / directories to back-up, choose where and how (as a simple file copy, as a zip archive, ...) they will be stored, and configure post-backup actions (like sending backup reports by email or launching custom shell scripts)

It has been designed to ...

... Be as simple as possible to set up : No complex configuration files to edit - Your backup configuration (stored as an XML file) can be edited with Areca's graphical user interface.

... Be as versatile as possible : Areca can use advanced backup modes (like "delta backup") or simply produce a basic copy of your source files as a standard directory or zip archive (readable by WinZip or other archivers).

... Allow you to interact with your archives : Browse your archives, track and recover a specific version of a file, merge a set of archives into a single one, etc.</description>
